# Full-Stack-Starter
Hosts a simple app using JavaScript full stack.

To be used as a base for new projects.

Current example is with Node.js and Express.js back-end, with Angular.js front-end using ui-router and ui-bootstrap.

Will eventually add branches for different front-end frameworks and back-end additions such as databases.
